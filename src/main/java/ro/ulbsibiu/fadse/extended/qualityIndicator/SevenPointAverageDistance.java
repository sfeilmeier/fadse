 * The average distance measure is similar to generational distance. For this metric the true Pareto front is not needed. It generates seven points (vectors) in objective space for comparison.
Assuming a bi-objective maximization problem and an (f1, f2) coordinate system with origin at (0,0). First the maximum value in each objective dimension is found (f1max and f2max). The 2 first points from the total of 7 are: (0,f2max) and (f1max,0). Then the next 5 points are computed. These points are: (0,f2max/3), (0,f2max/2), (f1max/3,0), (f1max/2,0) and (0,0).
The average distance measure is the average Euclidean distances from each of the seven axis points to closest individual of the known Pareto front.
